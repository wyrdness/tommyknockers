      "full": "Tommyknockers are American mine spirits, an Americanization of the Cornish 'knockers' brought to the United States by Cornish immigrant miners in the 19th century. Described as small, bearded figures dressed in mining clothes, tommyknockers knock on mine walls to communicate with miners. Their knocking patterns carry specific meanings: three knocks indicate a rich ore vein nearby, while rapid, frantic knocking warns of imminent danger—cave-ins, gas pockets, or other hazards—signaling miners to leave immediately. Miners who showed respect by leaving lunch scraps and maintaining proper mine etiquette were helped by tommyknockers, while those who disrespected them faced misleading or danger. The belief was particularly strong in Western U.S. hard rock mining regions (Colorado, Nevada, California) and Pennsylvania coal mines. Miners credited tommyknockers with saving lives through their warnings, with reports continuing into the early 20th century. Stephen King's 1987 horror novel 'The Tommyknockers' gave a darker interpretation to the folklore. Tommyknockers represent important American mining community tradition and Cornish immigrant cultural heritage."
